Notes on the gothic data 
for quick niche/random tests 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I have TWO versions of the gothic data:
(1) The version received in 2010 from David Inouye, it (I should check my notes on this) excludes some species (wind pollinated so no Artemisia or grasses) and had some other small issues. I refer to this as the ‘OLD’ version.
(2) The version Jim Regetz and I made over several years that have never been used for analyses … yet. It includes all species and takes all count data whether it was a flower, capitula etc.. I refer to this as the ‘CLEAN’ data.

So. for the OLD data I actually had made FFD data at the plot level (in 2011) and peak flowering data at the plot level (in 2013 last apparently). I dusted these up and included them. I did not go to the trouble to calculate last flowering date, but could if you like.

For the CLEAN data I extracted first (ffd), last (lfd) and peak (pfd) flowering dates per species per ‘plot.’ Plot comes in two flavors though (more below) …

Plots

‘PlotNum’ which is a true plot — the ones that are several sq. meters — it is a two letter code plus number (e.g., GH2, VM3).

There is also a greater ‘plot’ (in the clean data this is called ‘plots’) which I refer to as SITE. That is just the two letter code (GH, VM etc.). These generally (but not always!) refer to distinct habitat: open rocky, wet meadow etc.. 

For the recent clean data I calculated everything BOTH ways, by small plot and by the larger site.

For the older data I noticed the peak flowering seems to be by site and the FFD by plotnumber (judging by file contents and the fact that peak is half as long as plot, the row number for peak is also more similar to the row number from the clean site-level data, numbers below). I am not sure how this happened from a quick glance at the code but could do it differently if needed. 

Rows in site data from CLEAN data: 5882
Rows in site data from OLD data: 4429
Rows in plot-level data from CLEAN data: 12695
Rows in plot-level data from OLD data: 9867

1973 data are suspect based on collection methods and should be handled with care.
